# Module - 2: Final Evaluation

Hi there! this is my final evaluation project for Adalab, hope you like it!
You can see the final product here: http://beta.adalab.es/modulo-2-evaluacion-final-Calpurniax/

> **First things first:** You need to have [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/) installed to run this project

### Steps to enjoy this lovely code I made:

1. Better **download** it than using git clone.
2. **Install dependencies** by typing the following in a terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the project! with:

```bash
npm start
```

## About the evaluation

It consists on developing a web-site using HTML and Css/Sass and JS, with a free design. We were required to focus on JS side to practice some good stuff like:

- array/objects
- manipulate DOM
- functions, loops, conditionals...
- Github
- never forget our friends Css/HTML

#### About the code

The project was typed with Visual Studio Code.
The framework is the Adalab Web Starter Kit, which allows us to enjoy gulp without worries (among other things).
The first idea was to use a fetch to a third party API, but sadly it's not working anymore, so now it's working (thanks to amazing Adalabers) with a json file

### thank you and have fun!
